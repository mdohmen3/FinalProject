In order to use my GUI, simply run the function bowlingScore in the command window. A GUI will appear where you can add each shot. If you knock all ten pins down in the first shot of the frame, hit the 'X' button to input a strike. If you get zero, use the '-' button, representing a miss. If you get a spare, use the '/' button. The GUI will give an error if you try to input something like 8 2 in a frame. In this case, the GUI prompts you to use the '/' button. There is a reset button in the bottom left corner which will start the game over, and, at the end of the game, there will be a pop-up telling you what your score was and asking if you would like to play again or quit. Hitting "Play Again" will start a new game, while doing anything else will quit the GUI entirely.
